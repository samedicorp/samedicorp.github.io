Greetings, fellow Dual Universe citizens.

My name is Samedi, and I spend a lot of my time in DU tinkering with Lua scripts.

I am still very much figuring out the best ways to do things, and thought that it might be useful if I share my thoughts. 

Possibly useful to you, but more-than-likely more useful to me when you tell my why I'm doing it all wrong...

At this point I'm not entirely sure how often I'll post. We'll have to see, I guess.
