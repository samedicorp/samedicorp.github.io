I'm aiming these posts at people who are starting out with Dual Universe scripting, but already know how to code.

I'm going to assume that you are familiar with one or more programming languages, and can find your way round Lua.

I'm going to assume that you know how to set up an IDE (I use Visual Studio Code for this stuff currently).

I am going to hope that you're familiar with the concepts of source control in general, and git in particular.

If some of these don't apply, don't worry, you can probably still get something out of what I'm saying - just be aware that you aren't the target audience and I won't necessarily explain every detail.

I've set up a [discussion board](https://github.com/samedicorp/samedicorp.github.io/discussions) for this blog, so feel free to leave me some feedback -- on the level of the posts, or anything else!
