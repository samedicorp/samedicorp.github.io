A while back, just before the Upvoting site was introduced, I was getting frustrated by how laborious it was to report bugs and make suggestions.

I decided that the main thing was to capture the information -- I'd worry later about how to pass it on -- so I made [a Github repository and started creating issues](https://github.com/samedicorp/dualuniverse-feedback/issues).

I do try to report each one as a bug or an upvote submission (though sadly a lot of the upvote ones have disappeared without a trace, so I may re-submit them as bugs).

I'm mentioning this here in case anyone is interested, and also because I'm still using this system, and will continue to do so. The issue tracker is public, and anyone else who wants to is free to submit things to it too.
